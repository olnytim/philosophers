# Philosophers Project - 42 School: Unleashing the Philosophical Concurrency! 🌌🔥

## Description ❗
Welcome to the realm of "Philosophers" – a captivating project embedded within the rich tapestry of 42 School's curriculum. Prepare yourself for an extraordinary adventure, delving into the depths of multithreading and synchronization concepts in the mystical realm of C. Your quest? To conquer the enigmatic "Dining Philosophers Problem."

## The Dining Philosophers Problem
Behold, the timeless puzzle of computer science – the Dining Philosophers Problem. Imagine a group of wise philosophers, seated around a celestial table, each holding a fork in both hands. Eager to feast on profound knowledge, a philosopher requires both forks to indulge in their intellectual nourishment. However, the universe has its limitations – there are only as many forks as there are philosophers, demanding a delicate dance of sharing.

Crafting a solution to this riddle demands ingenuity and wisdom. Your task is to design an elegant answer that thwarts deadlocks, where philosophers endlessly yearn for a fork, and avoids the chaos of resource contention, where multiple seekers vie for the same utensil simultaneously.

## Project Objectives
Embark on a heroic odyssey to unlock the secrets of the Dining Philosophers Problem. Wield threads and synchronize their steps like a virtuoso conductor, guiding them through a mesmerizing symphony of eating, sleeping, and contemplating the universe. Your noble mission encompasses the following sacred goals:

1. Instill the gift of balance in each philosopher, allowing them to gracefully alternate between eating, sleeping, and deep reflection. 🍽️😴🤔
2. Empower the seekers of wisdom to dine at the banquet of knowledge, but only when they grasp both forks with harmonious precision. 🍴🍽️💡
3. Unite the forks as symbols of camaraderie, shared between two neighboring philosophers, fostering a spirit of harmony and understanding. 🤝🍴🤗
4. Banish the specters of deadlock and resource contention, bringing forth an era of peace and intellectual flourishing. ✨🌿

## Project Requirements
Heed the ancient wisdom of coding – the sacred language of C shall be your guide. Threads shall be your companions, and the art of synchronization through mutexes and/or semaphores your loyal allies.

Prepare a ritual, invoking three essential incantations: the number of philosophers, the time to die (in milliseconds), and the time to eat/think/sleep (in milliseconds). Utter the words, and witness the mesmerizing actions and states of each philosopher – eating, sleeping, and pondering the universe's mysteries.

But be warned, for the universe is both beautiful and unforgiving. Should any philosopher meet their untimely demise, your program must gracefully exit and return to the celestial plane from whence it came.

## How to Run the Program
Venture forth by either cloning this sacred repository or copying its arcane wisdom to your own machine. Invoke the compiler's power using the `make` command, and behold as the project awakens from its slumber.

Now, seize the moment! Unleash the power of the philosophers by invoking the compiled executable, witnessing the grand spectacle of concurrency. With the proper incantation (e.g., `./philosophers 5 800 200 200`), the saga will unfold before your very eyes.

## Additional Notes
Behold, the "Philosophers" project is no mere test of your abilities; it is an initiation into the esoteric realms of concurrency and synchronization. Embrace this profound challenge, for it shall shape your understanding and sharpen your skills. Remember, success lies in your hands, crafting a solution that transcends the shackles of deadlock and illuminates the path to unparalleled efficiency. May your journey be filled with wonder and wisdom, dear seeker of knowledge. 🚀🔥
